# Authentication Guide

This application uses Auth0 for authentication. To access the application:

1. Click the "Login" button
2. You will be redirected to Auth0's login page
3. Choose one of the following options:
   - Sign up for a new account using your email
   - Login with an existing Auth0 account
   - Use social login if configured (Google, GitHub, etc.)

Note: There is no fixed username/password as authentication is handled securely through Auth0's service.

For issues with login:
- Ensure you're using the correct email address
- Use the "Forgot Password" option if needed
- Contact your system administrator if you need access
